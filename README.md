## 🙏 Credits

This project is based on the **Simon Game Challenge** from the  
[**Complete Web Development Bootcamp**](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)  
by [**Dr. Angela Yu**](https://github.com/angelabauer).

I’ve modified and extended the original version to add volume control, polish the logic, and deepen my understanding of front-end development.
